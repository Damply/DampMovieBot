Python discord bot



# Modules
  ```python3 -m pip install -U discord.py```
  
  ```pip3 install git+https://github.com/alberanid/imdbpy```
  
  ```pip3 install pyperclip```
  
  ```pip3 install pyshorteners```
  
 # Things you will need
Go to [videospider](https://videospider.in/) and make an account. Then take your ID url and put it in the line 8 spider variable like so. ![alt](https://i.imgur.com/eMMP3Wk.png)

You will obviously also need a discord bot, get its token and put it in the token variable.
  
  ## This is still a work in progress. Anyone is welcome to help and improve the bot. Enjoy!
